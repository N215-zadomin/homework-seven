This week, our homework assignment was to finish up the last three pages of the Travel-Fly prototype. Like always, our main tasks were to copy the site exactly and to make sure it is responsive using media queries and percentages. We are yet again practicing how to upload items to GitHub, and learning how to use code we have already used.
